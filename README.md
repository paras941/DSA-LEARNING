📘 DSA-QUESTIONS

This repository contains a collection of C++ multiple-choice quiz questions designed to help students and developers test and strengthen their understanding of C++.

🧾 Overview

The quiz covers fundamental and intermediate concepts of C++ such as:

Data types and memory allocation

File handling

Pointers and references

Functions and parameter passing

Preprocessor directives and macros

Exception handling

Object-oriented programming concepts (e.g., polymorphism, this pointer)

Each question is accompanied by:

Multiple-choice options

Correct answer

Explanation for better understanding

📌 Example Topics

Size of special data types like wchar_t

File opening modes (text vs binary)

Behavior of the this pointer

Function call mechanisms (value, reference, pointer)

Exception handling (try, catch, throw)

Polymorphism in OOP

Macros and preprocessor directives

string header file questions 

pointers questions
